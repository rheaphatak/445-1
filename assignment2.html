<h1> Part 1 </h1>
<p>
Some common themes I noticed: <br><br>
Common categories in media consumption include music, movies, and TV shows.<br><br>
Many students faced challenges with complex softwares (such as photo and video editing softwares), as well as issues relating to accessibility (subtitles for movies, etc.) <br><br>
There is a vast amount of media available for consumption, and students pointed out that it can be difficult to find specific content that they are interested in.<br><br>

</p>

<h1> Part 2 </h1>
<p> I would revise my categorization by classifying based on media I consume and produce. For example, movies and TV shows could be categorized as media consumption, and emails or other forms of messaging would be media production. I would also add another layer that specifies whether the media is video, audio or text based. </p>
