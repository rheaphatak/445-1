<p>Why I am taking this class: </p>



<p> Assignment requirements: 
Section 1: Include your name, a photo of yourself, and a brief statement on why you are in this class.  

Section 2: Create a list of media you frequently use either as a consumer of content (e.g. television) or as a generator of content (e.g. email).  You should subdivide the higher-level media (e.g. television), into more specific media (e.g. science fiction shows). Feel free to specify specific instances (e.g. Stranger Things, Andor) although you do not need to specify all. As a starting point, one categorization of high-level media might be music, games, still images, moving images and then subdivide these based on genres and/or device (some media are more intrinsically on a particular device, e.g. cell phone, television, smart speaker, etc.) 

Section 3: Identify a challenge or difficulty with the tools/software/hardware related to your content generation or consumption. </p>
